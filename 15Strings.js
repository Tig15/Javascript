// The group or collection of alphabets and numerical value are called as Strings. They are written inside single qoute, double qoute and backtick.

// Suppose

const myName = "AMAN"

console.log(myName[1]) // Here, i tried to access the array by index number.

console.log(myName.charAt(2)) // Here, i used method charAt, which gave me the character at that index number.

// Here, we are going to get String as Object when we use keyword "new"
const lang = new String("Javascript")
console.log(lang)

console.log(typeof(lang))

const left = "DA"
console.log(myName.concat(left)) // We use conact or concatetion method to add two strings.
